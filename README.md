# Expense-Tracker
I have developed an expense tracker application using JavaScript for both the frontend and backend, with CSS for styling. The application allows users to easily track and manage their expenses. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, categorizing, and viewing expenses, making it a handy tool for personal finance management
